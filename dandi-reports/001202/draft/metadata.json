  "description": "In this study, we investigate the neuronal response to transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) stimulation on somatosensory cortex by using a 128-element array transducer. Intracranial recordings were performed using a 32-channel Soft NET Probe, which is compatible with tFUS. The electrode was chronically implanted  and can be repeatedly used. Wistar rats were anesthetized using isoflurane at 2% during recording session. tFUS with different parameters was applied every 2.5s (\u00b110%). This dataset contains spike times of the sorted neural signals and event time for each tFUS trial. In these recordings, we test different pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs)  and pressure levels of ultrasound stimulation to explore the neuronal response to tFUS. The pulse duration was kept at 67ms. Each recording has 500 trials. We also compare two setup of the transducer, one is with a collimator and the other one is without the collimator, to explore the better setup for chronic recording and tFUS modulation.",
