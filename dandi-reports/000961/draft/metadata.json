  "description": "This dataset includes electrophysiological and optical recordings across six mice. Simultaneous recordings were obtained through the use of a flexible, insertable and transparent microelectrode array (Neuro-FITM), ranging from 16 to 32 channels. Electrophysiology recordings were obtained from deep cortical layers and subcortical structures. Optical recordings were obtained via wide-field calcium imaging across the dorsal cortex. This data was obtained through a collaboration between Takaki Komiyama and Duygu Kuzum at the University of California, San Diego and is featured in the following paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00841-5.",
