One animal (\"M1\") receives a low-amplitude microstimulation to one of three brain areas (OFC, ACCg, and dmPFC) that is triggered stochastically upon looking to their partner's eye-region. These data consist of the continuous gaze positions and pupil sizes from each animal; the stimulation event times; the face and eye ROIs of each animal; and the multi-unit activity (MUA) and electrode information from the single electrode targeting the stimulated area.",
