      "description": "In this study, we investigate how transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical stimulation at hindlimb through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex. Recordings were performed using a 32-channel NeuroNexus\u00ae multi-electrode array. Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane at 2%. Recordings were taken while delivering peripheral electrical stimulation once every 5 seconds to analyze the neural response in the rat S1HL region, before ultrasound for 30 minutes and then afterwards for an hour, in order to determine how the ultrasound modulated the electrical stimulation induced local field potential (LFP) waveforms. We delivered ultrasound for 5 minutes in a pulsed pattern at 5 levels of sonication repetition frequencies (SRF) (10 Hz, 50 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 125 Hz) to induce frequency dependent plasticity in a manner similar to that is found following tetanic electrical stimulation. We investigated whether delivering tFUS that alters connectivity/correlation between the targeted neurons may alter collective responses manifested in the modulated LFP waveforms. The applied fundamental frequency of ultrasound was 0.5 MHz, the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was 3 kHz, and the total duty cycle was 36%. This dataset contains LFP recordings, with 32 channels for each datafile.\nIn each subject, recordings are provided with \"pre\" and \"post\" tFUS for two different frequencies (SRF), and most contain recordings during the delivery of ultrasound and during rest periods between sessions of different ultrasound parameters. For example, a single subject may include \"100Hz_pre\", \"100Hz_post\", \"50Hz_pre\", \"50Hz_post\", which are the pre and post tFUS recordings for the two used parameters, and then \"50Hz\" and \"100Hz\", which are the recordings taken during stimulation, and \"rest1\" and \"rest2\", which are the rest periods between sessions. These names are preceded by a label such as \"BH280\", which is the animal subject label. Ultrasound is delivered in a continuous paradigm, with pulses delivered at the stimulation repetition frequency continuously throughout the 5 minutes of stimulation. During the \"pre\" and \"post\" recordings, the peripheral electrical stimulation is delivered once every 5 seconds approximately. Electrical stimulation event trigger is not included in the dataset as it was not recorded due to using a separate system to deliver the electrical stimulation. We were using threshold detection on a channel of LFP recordings in order to detect the electrical stimulation events, in which events can be recognized by the quick rising of voltage. One could also approximate it by detecting the first event, and then add periods of 5 seconds to generate the rest of the trigger times.\nMore details about the experimental details can be found in our paper published by Journal of Neural Engineering (DOI: 10.1088/1741-2552/ac889f).",

      "description": "In this study, we investigate how transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical stimulation at hindlimb through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex. Recordings were performed using a 32-channel NeuroNexus\u00ae multi-electrode array. Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane at 2%. Recordings were taken while delivering peripheral electrical stimulation once every 5 seconds to analyze the neural response in the rat S1HL region, before ultrasound for 30 minutes and then afterwards for an hour, in order to determine how the ultrasound modulated the electrical stimulation induced local field potential (LFP) waveforms. We delivered ultrasound for 5 minutes in a pulsed pattern at 5 levels of sonication repetition frequencies (SRF) (10 Hz, 50 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 125 Hz) to induce frequency dependent plasticity in a manner similar to that is found following tetanic electrical stimulation. We investigated whether delivering tFUS that alters connectivity/correlation between the targeted neurons may alter collective responses manifested in the modulated LFP waveforms. The applied fundamental frequency of ultrasound was 0.5 MHz, the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was 3 kHz, and the total duty cycle was 36%. This dataset contains LFP recordings, with 32 channels for each datafile.\nIn each subject, recordings are provided with \"pre\" and \"post\" tFUS for two different frequencies (SRF), and most contain recordings during the delivery of ultrasound and during rest periods between sessions of different ultrasound parameters. For example, a single subject may include \"100Hz_pre\", \"100Hz_post\", \"50Hz_pre\", \"50Hz_post\", which are the pre and post tFUS recordings for the two used parameters, and then \"50Hz\" and \"100Hz\", which are the recordings taken during stimulation, and \"rest1\" and \"rest2\", which are the rest periods between sessions. These names are preceded by a label such as \"BH280\", which is the animal subject label. Ultrasound is delivered in a continuous paradigm, with pulses delivered at the stimulation repetition frequency continuously throughout the 5 minutes of stimulation. During the \"pre\" and \"post\" recordings, the peripheral electrical stimulation is delivered once every 5 seconds approximately. Electrical stimulation event trigger is not included in the dataset as it was not recorded due to using a separate system to deliver the electrical stimulation. We were using threshold detection on a channel of LFP recordings in order to detect the electrical stimulation events, in which events can be recognized by the quick rising of voltage. One could also approximate it by detecting the first event, and then add periods of 5 seconds to generate the rest of the trigger times.\nMore details about the experimental details can be found in our paper published by Journal of Neural Engineering (DOI: 10.1088/1741-2552/ac889f).",

      "description": "In this study, we investigate how transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical stimulation at hindlimb through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex. Recordings were performed using a 32-channel NeuroNexus\u00ae multi-electrode array. Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane at 2%. Recordings were taken while delivering peripheral electrical stimulation once every 5 seconds to analyze the neural response in the rat S1HL region, before ultrasound for 30 minutes and then afterwards for an hour, in order to determine how the ultrasound modulated the electrical stimulation induced local field potential (LFP) waveforms. We delivered ultrasound for 5 minutes in a pulsed pattern at 5 levels of sonication repetition frequencies (SRF) (10 Hz, 50 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 125 Hz) to induce frequency dependent plasticity in a manner similar to that is found following tetanic electrical stimulation. We investigated whether delivering tFUS that alters connectivity/correlation between the targeted neurons may alter collective responses manifested in the modulated LFP waveforms. The applied fundamental frequency of ultrasound was 0.5 MHz, the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was 3 kHz, and the total duty cycle was 36%. This dataset contains LFP recordings, with 32 channels for each datafile.\nIn each subject, recordings are provided with \"pre\" and \"post\" tFUS for two different frequencies (SRF), and most contain recordings during the delivery of ultrasound and during rest periods between sessions of different ultrasound parameters. For example, a single subject may include \"100Hz_pre\", \"100Hz_post\", \"50Hz_pre\", \"50Hz_post\", which are the pre and post tFUS recordings for the two used parameters, and then \"50Hz\" and \"100Hz\", which are the recordings taken during stimulation, and \"rest1\" and \"rest2\", which are the rest periods between sessions. These names are preceded by a label such as \"BH280\", which is the animal subject label. Ultrasound is delivered in a continuous paradigm, with pulses delivered at the stimulation repetition frequency continuously throughout the 5 minutes of stimulation. During the \"pre\" and \"post\" recordings, the peripheral electrical stimulation is delivered once every 5 seconds approximately. Electrical stimulation event trigger is not included in the dataset as it was not recorded due to using a separate system to deliver the electrical stimulation. We were using threshold detection on a channel of LFP recordings in order to detect the electrical stimulation events, in which events can be recognized by the quick rising of voltage. One could also approximate it by detecting the first event, and then add periods of 5 seconds to generate the rest of the trigger times.\nMore details about the experimental details can be found in our paper published by Journal of Neural Engineering (DOI: 10.1088/1741-2552/ac889f).",

      "description": "In this study, we investigate how transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical stimulation at hindlimb through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex. Recordings were performed using a 32-channel NeuroNexus\u00ae multi-electrode array. Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane at 2%. Recordings were taken while delivering peripheral electrical stimulation once every 5 seconds to analyze the neural response in the rat S1HL region, before ultrasound for 30 minutes and then afterwards for an hour, in order to determine how the ultrasound modulated the electrical stimulation induced local field potential (LFP) waveforms. We delivered ultrasound for 5 minutes in a pulsed pattern at 5 levels of sonication repetition frequencies (SRF) (10 Hz, 50 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 125 Hz) to induce frequency dependent plasticity in a manner similar to that is found following tetanic electrical stimulation. We investigated whether delivering tFUS that alters connectivity/correlation between the targeted neurons may alter collective responses manifested in the modulated LFP waveforms. The applied fundamental frequency of ultrasound was 0.5 MHz, the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was 3 kHz, and the total duty cycle was 36%. This dataset contains LFP recordings, with 32 channels for each datafile.\nIn each subject, recordings are provided with \"pre\" and \"post\" tFUS for two different frequencies (SRF), and most contain recordings during the delivery of ultrasound and during rest periods between sessions of different ultrasound parameters. For example, a single subject may include \"100Hz_pre\", \"100Hz_post\", \"50Hz_pre\", \"50Hz_post\", which are the pre and post tFUS recordings for the two used parameters, and then \"50Hz\" and \"100Hz\", which are the recordings taken during stimulation, and \"rest1\" and \"rest2\", which are the rest periods between sessions. These names are preceded by a label such as \"BH280\", which is the animal subject label. Ultrasound is delivered in a continuous paradigm, with pulses delivered at the stimulation repetition frequency continuously throughout the 5 minutes of stimulation. During the \"pre\" and \"post\" recordings, the peripheral electrical stimulation is delivered once every 5 seconds approximately. Electrical stimulation event trigger is not included in the dataset as it was not recorded due to using a separate system to deliver the electrical stimulation. We were using threshold detection on a channel of LFP recordings in order to detect the electrical stimulation events, in which events can be recognized by the quick rising of voltage. One could also approximate it by detecting the first event, and then add periods of 5 seconds to generate the rest of the trigger times.\nMore details about the experimental details can be found in our paper published by Journal of Neural Engineering (DOI: 10.1088/1741-2552/ac889f).",
