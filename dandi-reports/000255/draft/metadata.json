  "description": "A three-dimensional (3D) concordance maps of cyto- and fiber architecture of the human brain, combining histology, immunohistochemistry, and 7-T quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in two individual specimens. These 3D maps each integrate data from approximately 800 microscopy sections per brain, showing neuronal and glial cell bodies, nerve fibers, and interneuronal populations, as well as ultrahigh-field quantitative MRI, all coaligned at the 200-\u00b5m scale to the stacked blockface images obtained during sectioning.",
