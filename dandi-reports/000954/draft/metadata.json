  "description": "The dataset contains neural activity from a period of open loop calibration from a human participant with an intracortical brain computer interface. This data was collected under an Investigational\nDevice Exemption from the Food and Drug Administration and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01894802). The clinical trial is an early feasibility study with a primary outcome of evaluating the safety of an intracortical brain\u2013computer interface for long-term neural recording and stimulation. Data was recorded from two 96-channel intracortical electrode arrays in the hand \"knob\" area . The 7DoF are: 3D endpoint translation (x,y,z) 1D orientation (roll), and 3D grasp (flex/ext of thumb, index, ring, flex/ext of ring/pinky, thumb abduction).\nOn each trial, audiovisual cues indicated to the participant to attempt a particular reach or grasp involving a combination of the listed degrees of freedom.\n\nThis dataset is part of the FALCON benchmark: https://snel-repo.github.io/falcon. The datafile contains the following data in the acquisition fields: 7D kinematics (`OpenLoopKinematics`), trial numbers (`TrialNum`), and metadata for FALCON evaluation (`eval_mask`, `Blacklist`). The datafile also contains multi-unit spiking activity in the `units` field.\n\nAs part of the FALCON challenge, dataset files are released in three ways. The held-in-calib data includes many trials of data intended for calibration of decoders in the FALCON challenge. The held-in-minival data is a small subset of the held-in-calib data intended for FALCON models to validate submission format. Lastly, held-out-calib data are separate sessions of data from held-in-calib, but have much fewer trials, intended to be used for few-shot recalibration. Please bear in mind these factors if making use of this dataset for purposes outside of the FALCON Benchmark. Each dataset split is considered one \"subject\" by the DANDI repository; only data from one iBCI participant is included.\n\nBy downloading this dataset, you are agreeing to terms of the following Data Use Agreement:\n- I will receive access to de-identified data and will not attempt to establish the identity of or attempt to contact any of the subjects.\n- I will not attempt to make direct contact with PIs, affiliated data partner PIs, or staff at sites concerning the specific results of individual subjects. Data partner PIs may be contacted about potential collaboration opportunities.\n- I will not further disclose these data beyond the uses outlined in this agreement and my data use application and understand that redistribution of data in any manner is prohibited.\n- I will require anyone on my team who utilizes these data or anyone with whom I share these data to comply with this Data Use Agreement.\n\n",
