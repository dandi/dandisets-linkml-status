description: "RESOLVE: High-Resolution Electrode System for LGN Visual Enhancement
  is a neuroengineering research project led by Dr. Lan Luan\u2019s laboratory at
  Rice University. The goal of RESOLVE is to investigate how high-density, ultraflexible
  neural electrode systems can be used to record from and stimulate the lateral geniculate
  nucleus (LGN) to understand visual encoding and to inform the development of next-generation
  visual prostheses.\n\nThe project integrates in vivo electrophysiology, electrical
  microstimulation, behavioral assays, and optical imaging in animal models to study
  LGN neural dynamics during visual stimulation and artificial activation. Experiments
  generate multi-channel neural recordings, stimulation event data, behavioral responses
  (including eye movements), and imaging-based measurements such as retinotopic maps.\n\nData
  generated under RESOLVE include raw electrophysiological recordings, stimulation
  and behavioral event logs, and associated metadata describing experimental conditions
  and acquisition parameters. By combining high-resolution neural interfaces with
  systematic analysis and open data sharing, RESOLVE aims to advance fundamental understanding
  of thalamic visual processing and accelerate the translation of LGN-based visual
  prosthetic strategies."
