description: This derivative dataset was compiled from data from a study conducted
  by the National Institute of Mental Health's Intramural Research Program from images
  acquired from the Systems Neuroscience Imaging Resource and reformatted into BIDS
  by the NIMH Data Science and Sharing Team. The derivative dataset contains Richardson-Lucy
  deconvloved and N4 intensity inhomogeneity corrected 3D image stacks and the analysis
  derivatives of the corrected image stacks from the CATNAP analysis pipeline, https://github.com/snehashis-roy/CATNIP.
  Data is from the publication "Constitutive and conditional deletion reveals distinct
  phenotypes driven by developmental versus neurotransmitter actions of the neuropeptide
  PACAP," https://doi.org/10.1111/jne.13286.
