description: "This dataset contains the raw data from behavioral and fiber photometry
  recording sessions for the first phase of a study investigating the effects of a
  dual enkephalinase inhibitor on stress-induced deficits in reward-seeking behavior
  in mice. The data is organized into individual session folders, each containing
  the files from a single experimental session. Each session folder is named with
  the following convention: [animal_id]_[session_type]_[session_day]_[YYYYMMDD]_[HHMMSS].
  Data Structure within each Session Folder: Each session folder contains a set of
  synchronized\_files from different recording systems:\n\ntask_data.mat\_/\_test_data.mat:\_A
  MATLAB\_.mat\_file\_containing the primary trial-structured behavioral data from
  the task control software. It is structured\_into two main variables:\nsessionInfo:
  Contains session-level metadata\_such as\_animalID,\_testDay,\_date,\_injectionStatus,\_stressStatus,
  etc.\ntrialData: A\_structure containing an array of trials. Each trial in the array
  is a structure with\_the following key fields:\ntrialNum: The trial number.\ncueTime:
  The absolute timestamp (from the behavioral system's clock) of the auditory cue
  onset.\nrewardTime: The\_absolute timestamp of the reward delivery.\nITIDuration:
  The duration\_of the inter-trial interval for that trial.\nresponded: A boolean
  flag (0 or 1) indicating if the animal successfully licked to receive a reward.\nrewardSize:
  A scalar value\_indicating the volume or amount of reward delivered on that trial.\nmonitoring_data.mat:\_A
  MATLAB\_.mat\_file containing continuous, high-temporal-resolution data streams
  from the behavioral monitoring system. This file is not trial-structured and\_contains
  raw sensor readings and synchronization signals, including:\nA continuous, high-frequency
  raw lick sensor signal.\nA TTL signal (sound_ttl) that goes high during the presentation
  of\_the auditory cue for precise event marking.\nA TTL signal (fp_ttl) sent from
  the fiber photometry system that goes high for the duration of the recording, used
  for synchronizing the two systems.\nFPdata[...].csv:\_A CSV file containing the
  raw data from the fiber photometry system. Each row is a single sample, with the
  following columns:\nComputerTimestamp: The timestamp (in milliseconds) from the
  photometry computer's clock.\nLedState: An integer indicating which LED was active
  for\_that sample (e.g., 1 for 470nm, 2 for\_410nm).\nG0: The raw fluorescence\_value
  recorded from the photodetector for that channel and timestamp.\nvideo[...].avi:\_A
  video file recording the animal's behavior during\_the session.\nvideo_timestamps[...].csv:\_A\_CSV
  file containing the precise timestamp for each frame acquired from the camera, as
  recorded by the camera\_control computer. This file typically contains a single
  column of timestamps in milliseconds.\n\nSynchronization Method: The different data
  streams are synchronized using a shared TTL pulse\_and precise timestamping.\n\nThe
  fiber photometry system generates a TTL pulse\_(fp_ttl) that is recorded by the
  behavioral monitoring system. The rising\_and falling edges of this pulse mark the
  exact start and end of the photometry recording on\_the\_behavioral clock.\nThe\_video_timestamps[...].csv\_provides
  a timestamp for each video frame on the\_camera's computer clock. The number\_of
  timestamps is matched against the total number of frames in the\_.avi\_file to ensure\_data
  integrity.\nBy aligning the start of the\_fp_ttl\_pulse\_from the behavioral data
  with the first timestamp in the\_FPdata\_CSV, and using\_the\_sound_ttl\_to align
  behavioral events, all data streams (trial\_events, neural activity, and video)
  can be precisely aligned in a common time\_base for analysis.\n\nCode Availability:
