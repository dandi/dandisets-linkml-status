  "description": "This dataset contains whole-cell current clamp recordings and confocal images from SuM (supramammillary nucleus) neurons in acute mouse brain slices. Recordings were obtained using 60x magnification with DAPI and EGFP fluorescence labeling. Included are ABF files representing individual cells and stimulation protocols, ND2 and TIF images for cellular morphology and localization, and structured metadata for reproducibility and reuse.",
