  "description": "This dataset is composed of electrophysiology data from a tetraplegic human participant implanted with two 48 channel Utah arrays (Blackrock) in S1 area 1 in the arm topographic region. The dataset includes preprocessed firing rate data for 96 recorded channels, and preprocessed linear decoding, RSA, and channel tuning analyses as described in Rosenthal et al, \"S1 represents multisensory contexts and somatotopic locations within and outside the bounds of the cortical homunculus,\" currently a preprint on bioArxiv.",
