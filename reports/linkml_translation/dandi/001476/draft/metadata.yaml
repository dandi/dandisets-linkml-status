description: 'The human genome is replete with sequences derived from foreign elements
  including endogenous retrovirus-like proteins of unknown function. Here we show
  that UBQLN2, a ubiquitin-proteasome shuttle factor implicated in neurodegenerative
  diseases, is regulated by the linked actions of two retrovirus-like proteins, RTL8
  and PEG10. RTL8 confers on UBQLN2 the ability to complex with and regulate PEG10.
  PEG10, a core component of stress granules, drives the recruitment of UBQLN2 to
  stress granules under various stress conditions, but can only do so when RTL8 is
  present. Changes in UBQLN2, RTL8 or PEG10 levels further remodel the kinetics of
  stress granule disassembly and translation recovery. PEG10 also alters overall stress
  granule composition by incorporating select extracellular vesicle proteins. Within
  stress granules, PEG10 forms virus-like particles, underscoring the structural heterogeneity
  of this class of biomolecular condensates. Together, these results reveal an unexpected
  link between pathways of cellular proteostasis and endogenous retrovirus-like proteins.
