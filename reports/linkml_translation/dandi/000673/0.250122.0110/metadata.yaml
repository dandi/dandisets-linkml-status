description: "Retaining information in working memory is a demanding process that
  relies on cognitive control to protect memoranda-specific persistent activity from
  interference. However, how cognitive control regulates working memory storage is
  unclear. Here we show that interactions of frontal control and hippocampal persistent
  activity are coordinated by theta\u2013gamma phase\u2013amplitude coupling (TG-PAC).
  We recorded single neurons in the human medial temporal and frontal lobe while patients
  maintained multiple items in their working memory. In the hippocampus, TG-PAC was
  indicative of working memory load and quality. We identified cells that selectively
  spiked during nonlinear interactions of theta phase and gamma amplitude. The spike
  timing of these PAC neurons was coordinated with frontal theta activity when cognitive
  control demand was high. By introducing noise correlations with persistently active
  neurons in the hippocampus, PAC neurons shaped the geometry of the population code.
  This led to higher-fidelity representations of working memory content that were
  associated with improved behaviour. Our results support a multicomponent architecture
  of working memory, with frontal control managing maintenance of working memory content
  in storage-related areas. Within this framework, hippocampal TG-PAC integrates cognitive
  control and working memory storage across brain areas, thereby suggesting a potential
  mechanism for top-down control over sensory-driven processes.\n\nSample code that
  illustrates how to replicate key figures/analysis in Daume et. al. can be found
  here: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/SBCAT-release-NWB\n\nNote: sub-35_ses-1_ecephys+image.nwb
  is missing mean/std waveform data, but these data can be derived from the raw spike
  waveforms included in the file."
