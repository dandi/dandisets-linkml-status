description: "Dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) are key neuromodulators that regulate
  striatal circuits underlying movement and reinforcement learning. Evidence suggests
  that DA and ACh systems interact, but where and how interactions are expressed across
  striatal regions in behaviorally relevant release dynamics remains unknown. We applied
  micro-fiber arrays to simultaneously measure striatum-wide DA and ACh in behaving
  mice, revealing an anatomical organization in which DA-ACh anti-correlations were
  concentrated in a hotspot in the anterior dorsolateral striatum (aDLS). Anti-correlations
  resulted from temporally coincident pairs of spontaneous and event-locked transient
  peak and dip events occurring in a DA\u2192ACh sequence. The aDLS localized hotspot
  was consistently expressed within distinct signals associated with unpredicted rewards,
  learned and extinguished Pavlovian cues, and locomotion initiation and invigoration
  phases, for which we revealed novel, opposing DA-ACh dynamics. Optogenetic activation
  of DA neurons selectively suppressed spontaneous ACh release within the aDLS hotspot,
  and ex vivo recordings revealed enhanced D2-mediated ACh inhibition in aDLS relative
  to ventral regions, suggesting a mechanistic basis for this spatial specificity.
  These findings demonstrate that DA-ACh interactions during behavior are spatially
  organized, rather than uniformly conserved, and shape behaviorally relevant dynamics
  to regulate region-specific functions in learning and movement control.  "
