description: "Memories are encoded in neural ensembles during learning and are\_stabilized
  by post-learning reactivation. Integrating recent experiences into existing memories
  ensures that memories contain the most recently available information, but how the
  brain accomplishes this critical process remains unclear. Here we show that in mice,
  a strong aversive experience drives offline ensemble reactivation of not only the
  recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed 2 days before, linking fear
  of the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory. Fear specifically
  links retrospectively, but not prospectively, to neutral memories across days. Consistent
  with previous studies, we find that the recent aversive memory ensemble is reactivated
  during the offline period after learning. However, a strong aversive experience
  also increases co-reactivation of the aversive and neutral memory ensembles during
  the offline period. Ensemble co-reactivation occurs more during wake than during
  sleep. Finally, the expression of fear in the neutral context is associated with
  reactivation of the shared ensemble between the aversive and neutral memories. Collectively,
  these results demonstrate that offline ensemble co-reactivation is a neural mechanism
  by which memories are integrated across days."
