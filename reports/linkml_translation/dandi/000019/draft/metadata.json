  "description": "The enclosed data is collected using a high-density 256-channel electrocorticography (ECoG) array implanted in human patients during treatment for epilepsy. The subjects are reading aloud consonant-vowel syllables from a list. The data was collected by Dr. Edward Chang and Dr. Kristofer Bouchard at the University of California, San Francisco, and curated by Dr. Kristofer Bouchard and Dr. Benjamin Dichter.\n\n\nData is organized by subject ID, and each file is a continuous recording session in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) 2.0 format. Voltage traces are included for each of the recorded 256 channels. Microphone signal was recorded at the time but is removed for HIPAA compliance. Detailed hand-marked annotations are provided which mark what syllable was said, and the times of the start, consonant-vowel transition, and end of each syllable. A rest-period time is also included when the subject was silent, which can be used as a baseline. Hand-marked anatomical labels are included for electrodes in the relevant brain regions. All dates have been removed for HIPAA compliance and replaced with Jan 1, 1900.",
