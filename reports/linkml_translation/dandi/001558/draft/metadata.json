  "description": "In this study, we performed simultaneous recordings of intracranial local field potentials (LFP) and EEG in a macaque monkey implanted with a chronic electrode system during transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS). Ultrasound was delivered using a 128-element array transducer targeting multiple brain regions including auditory cortex (A1), somatosensory cortex (S1), and the thalamus (VPLc). All recordings were conducted in an awake, passively resting animal.  Each session includes alternating active and sham trials. In active trials, ultrasound was delivered using parameterized pulse trains with varied pulse repetition frequency (PRF: 40 Hz, 300 Hz, 1500 Hz, 3000 Hz) and stimulation amplitude (estimated in situ pressure 15 - 255 kPa). Sham trials were interleaved by redirecting ultrasound to a collimator. Ultrasound duration was fixed at 300 ms, and auditory cue (white noise) if delivered was at 200 ms post-tFUS-onset for 25 ms. Raw electrophysiology data includes broadband LFP recordings from around 800 channels across 14 coronal slices and 33-channel EEG data acquired simultaneously, concatenated into [N_channels \u00d7 N_timepoints (ms) \u00d7 N_trials].",
