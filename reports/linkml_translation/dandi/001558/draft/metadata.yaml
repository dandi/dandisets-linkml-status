description: "In this study, we performed simultaneous recordings of intracranial
  local field potentials (LFP) and EEG in a macaque monkey implanted with a chronic
  electrode system during transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS). Ultrasound
  was delivered using a 128-element array transducer targeting multiple brain regions
  including auditory cortex (A1), somatosensory cortex (S1), and the thalamus (VPLc).
  All recordings were conducted in an awake, passively resting animal.  Each session
  includes alternating active and sham trials. In active trials, ultrasound was delivered
  using parameterized pulse trains with varied pulse repetition frequency (PRF: 40
  Hz, 300 Hz, 1500 Hz, 3000 Hz) and stimulation amplitude (estimated in situ pressure
  15 - 255 kPa). Sham trials were interleaved by redirecting ultrasound to a collimator.
  Ultrasound duration was fixed at 300 ms, and auditory cue (white noise) if delivered
  was at 200 ms post-tFUS-onset for 25 ms. Raw electrophysiology data includes broadband
  LFP recordings from around 800 channels across 14 coronal slices and 33-channel
  EEG data acquired simultaneously, concatenated into [N_channels \xD7 N_timepoints
  (ms) \xD7 N_trials]."
