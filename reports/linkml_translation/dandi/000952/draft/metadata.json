  "description": "Local field potential (LFP) recordings from 12 male Long-Evans rats during a temporal discounting task. LFP was recording using an RHD interface board (Intantech) and Open Ephys recording software. Data was recorded at 1Khz, with a band-pass filter set at 0.3 to 999 Hz during acquisition. Physiology data was integrated with behavioral data using a lab-streaming-layer (LSL) protocol. Recordings are taken from 32 different brain areas. Subjects chose between a small (10uL/ 1s) reward delivered after a fixed short delay (500ms after response) or a large (30uL/3s) reward delivered after a fixed delay that varied from session to session (500ms, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20s).
