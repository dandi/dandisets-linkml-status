description: "- TEM dataset for AxonDeepSeg (https://axondeepseg.readthedocs.io/)\n\n-
  158 brain (splenium) samples from 20 mice with axon and myelin manual segmentation
  labels.\n\n- Every individual axon is separated from neighboring fibers with a 2
  pixel delineation, such that this semantic segmentation dataset also doubles as
  an instance segmentation dataset.\n\n- In our original paper (Zaimi et al. 2018),
  the FOV was reported to be 6x9 um^2. This is because 1) these original values were
  reported in the original data reference (below), and 2) our images here are slightly
  cropped at the bottom relative to the original data in order to remove the scale
  bar.\n\n- Our original paper (Zaimi et al. 2018) reported the resolution as being
  0.002 micrometer, which was (for an unknown reason) rounded in the paper from the
  true value of 0.00236 micrometer, as reported in the original data reference (below).\n\n-
  Reference for the origin of the data: Jelescu, I. O. et al. In vivo quantification
  of demyelination and recovery using compartment-specific diffusion MRI metrics validated
  by electron microscopy. Neuroimage 132, 104\u2013114 (2016). See https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.02.004
  (Center for Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, New York University School
  of Medicine, New York, NY, USA)\n\n- The original aim of the 2016 study was to quantify
  demyelination in mice intoxicated with cuprizone in both accute (6 weeks) and chronic
  (12 weeks) scenarios. As such, this dataset includes samples from both healthy and
  intoxicated mouse groups."
