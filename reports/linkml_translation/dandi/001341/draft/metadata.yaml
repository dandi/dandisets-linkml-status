description: Electrophysiology in the C2 barrel column of wS1 in mice during continuous
  tactile VR navigation using only the C2 whiskers. Mice are head-fixed on a suspended
  ball, with two walls placed either side of the mouse. The lateral movement of these
  walls is coupled in a closed loop real time system to the trajectory of the mouse
  so that when the mouse moves to the left, the walls move in from the left. This
  causes them to orient themselves in the middle of the virtual corridor. Mice are
  presented with turns to the left (contralateral stimulation to recording site) and
  right (ipsilateral to recording site) in the virtual environment in a completely
  unrewarded form of a 2AFC task. Trial structure consists of a 100cm closed loop
  baseline straight running trial, before an open loop 2 second turn to either the
  left or right. Mouse trajectories (forward and lateral distance and speed) calculated
  from ball tracking cameras using custom LabVIEW program.
