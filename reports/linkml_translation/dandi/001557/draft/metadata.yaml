description: "Microglia regulate neuronal circuit plasticity. Disrupting their homeostatic
  function has detrimental effects on neuronal circuit health. Neuroinflammation contributes
  to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s
  disease (AD), with several microglial activation genes linked to increased risk
  for these conditions. Inflammatory microglia alter neuronal excitability, inducing
  metabolic strain. Interestingly, expression of APOE4, the strongest genetic risk
  factor for AD, affects both microglial activation and neuronal excitability, highlighting
  the interplay between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal function. It
  remains unclear how microglial inflammatory state is conveyed to neurons to affect
  circuit function and whether APOE4 expression alters this intercellular communication.
  Here, we use a reductionist model of human iPSC-derived microglial and neuronal
  monocultures to dissect how the APOE genotype in each cell-type independently contributes
  to microglial regulation of neuronal activity during inflammation. Conditioned media
  (CM) from LPS-stimulated microglia increased neuronal network activity, assessed
  by calcium imaging, with APOE4 microglial CM driving greater neuronal activity than
  APOE3 CM. Both APOE3 and APOE4 neurons increase network activity in response to
  CM treatments, while APOE4 neurons uniquely increase presynaptic puncta in response
  to APOE4 microglial CM. CM-derived exosomes from LPS-stimulated microglia can mediate
  increases to network activity. Lastly, increased network activity is accompanied
  by increased lipid droplet (LD) metabolism and blocking LD metabolism abolishes
  network activity. These findings illuminate how microglia-to-neuron communication
  drives inflammation-induced changes in neuronal circuit function, demonstrate a
  role for neuronal LDs in network activity, and support a potential mechanism through
  which APOE4 increases neuronal excitability."
