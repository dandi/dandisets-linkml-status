studyTarget:
- We explore the role of mechanosensation in accurately estimating self-rotation during
  rapid flight saccades.  Like mammalian head-direction cells, flies update their
  heading representation via GLNO neurons that relay idiothetic sensory information
  to EPG compass neurons within the central complex. We functionally imaged left and
  right GLNO neuron activity in the fly brain, alongside recordings of wingstroke
  amplitudes during mechanical and visual stimulations at different simulated rotation
  speeds. Two-photon microscopy recordings use GCaMP7f, a Ca2+-indicator, alongside
  an activity-independent red fluorophore, tdTomato. tdTomato is used for image-stabilization
  and GCaMP-fluorescence normalization.
