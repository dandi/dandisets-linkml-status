  "studyTarget": [
    "We explore the role of mechanosensation in accurately estimating self-rotation during rapid flight saccades.  Like mammalian head-direction cells, flies update their heading representation via GLNO neurons that relay idiothetic sensory information to EPG compass neurons within the central complex. We functionally imaged left and right GLNO neuron activity in the fly brain, alongside recordings of wingstroke amplitudes during mechanical and visual stimulations at different simulated rotation speeds. Two-photon microscopy recordings use GCaMP7f, a Ca2+-indicator, alongside an activity-independent red fluorophore, tdTomato. tdTomato is used for image-stabilization and GCaMP-fluorescence normalization."
