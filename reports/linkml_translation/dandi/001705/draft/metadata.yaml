description: 'An appropriate stress response is essential for proper responding to,
  coping with, and subsequently recover from disturbing environmental stressors. However,
  the dysregulated responses to stress stimuli can result in abnormal psychiatric
  and behavioral outcomes, and if severe, can lead to stress-related mental disorders
  such as the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To develop effective therapies
  for treating these disorders, it is of utmost importance to fully understand the
  brain neural bases and mechanisms regulating stress responses. Emerging evidence
  indicates that stress-related emotional modalities are equally implicated in feeding
  regulation by hypothalamic neurons, suggesting that common neurocircuits co-regulate
  stress and feeding. Our tracing studies indicate that non-AgRP GABAergic neurons
  in the arcuate nucleus (Arc, denoted as ArcGABA neurons) send direct inputs to corticotropin-releasing
  hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH, denoted
  as PVHCRH neurons). While PVHCRH neurons exhibit time-locked activation in response
  to various environmental stressors, we found that both GABA release onto PVHCRH
  neurons and ArcGABA neuron activity decrease under chronic stress conditions (e.g.,
  tail suspension and restraint), but not under acute stressors (e.g., water spray
  and air puff). Specifically, ArcGABA neuronal activity correlates with GABA release
  onto PVHCRH neurons, but it is anticorrelated with PVHCRH neuronal activity in response
  to the same stressor. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of PVHCRH-projecting
  ArcGABA neurons enhances PVHCRH neuronal activity and elevates stress levels, phenocopying
  the direct activation of PVHCRH neurons. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of
  PVHCRH-projecting ArcGABA neurons reduces both PVHCRH neuronal activity and stress
  levels, and this phenotype can be completely abolished by concurrent excitation
  of PVHCRH neurons. Altogether, our findings indicate that non-AgRP ArcGABA neurons
  play a critical role in encoding the scalability of stress responses to environmental
  stressors by modulating inhibitory GABA release onto PVHCRH neurons in a stimulus
  strength-dependent manner.   '
