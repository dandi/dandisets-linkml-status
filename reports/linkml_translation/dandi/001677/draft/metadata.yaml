description: 'Retinal tissue was obtained from Long-Evans rats that received stereotactic
  injections of AAV2retro-CAG-ReaChR-mCitrine into the superior colliculus. This retrograde
  viral approach resulted in expression of the red-shifted channelrhodopsin ReaChR
  and the fluorophore mCitrine in retinotectal RGCs.

  Ex vivo retinal recordings were performed on 512-electrode arrays following pharmacological
  blockade of photoreceptor-mediated responses using L-AP4, DL-AP5, and CNQX. LED
  flashes at 565 nm were delivered at multiple intensities and durations (10, 30,
  100, and 200 ms) to selectively activate ReaChR-expressing cells. The dataset contains
  recordings from 6 experiments, each capturing responses from hundreds of RGCs to
  the LED stimulation protocol.'
