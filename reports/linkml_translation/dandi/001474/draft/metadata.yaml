description: "Fiber photometry and linked behavioural data examining feeding-evoked
  response dynamics in hypothalamic satiety neurons.\n\nFood consumption-evoked responses
  in PVHMC4R neurons increase gradually during meal consumption to promote satiety,
  and disrupting this process drives massive obesity. These critical\nsatiety neurons
  are strongly affected by a high-fat diet, yet the impact on their functional properties
  remains unknown. We used fiber photometry to track PVHMC4R neurons\u2019 responses
  to the consumption of drops of milkshake in animals fed a chow diet or a high-fat
  diet (HFD), both after obesity was established and after its reversal. "
