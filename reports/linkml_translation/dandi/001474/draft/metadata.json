  "description": "Fiber photometry and linked behavioural data examining feeding-evoked response dynamics in hypothalamic satiety neurons.\n\nFood consumption-evoked responses in PVHMC4R neurons increase gradually during meal consumption to promote satiety, and disrupting this process drives massive obesity. These critical\nsatiety neurons are strongly affected by a high-fat diet, yet the impact on their functional properties remains unknown. We used fiber photometry to track PVHMC4R neurons\u2019 responses to the consumption of drops of milkshake in animals fed a chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD), both after obesity was established and after its reversal.
