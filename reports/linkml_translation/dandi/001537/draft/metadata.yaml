description: "Transient stoppages of red blood cell (RBC) flow through capillaries\u2014termed
  capillary stalls\u2014occur persistently in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s
  disease and ischemic stroke and can interrupt oxygen delivery and exacerbate neurological
  damage. Effective imaging tools and analyses are necessary to understand the nature,
  role, and prevention of stalls. In this study, we dissect differences in stalls
  measured by two-photon Bessel beam microscopy (Bessel-2PM) and optical coherence
  tomography (OCT) to gain insight into the temporal dynamics of stalls. Twenty-minute
  series of volumetric angiograms were obtained separately with Bessel-2PM and OCT
  on the same day in awake, head-fixed mice. The temporal dynamics of stalling in
  both methods revealed a minority population of susceptible capillaries that exhibited
  frequent stalls and a large majority of capillaries with infrequent stalls. Differences
  between OCT and Bessel-2PM in the repeatability and dynamics of stalls are explained
  by differences in their sensitivity to short or infrequent stalls based on scanning
  speed and detection off-time. Finally, stroke caused a shift toward the frequently
  stalling capillary subpopulation, lasting 1 week post-stroke. Dynamic stall analysis
  therefore enables examination of physiological and methodological contributions
  to the stalls measured in disease models and across studies."
