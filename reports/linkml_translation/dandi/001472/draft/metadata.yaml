description: "The cognitive processes supporting complex animal behavior are closely
  associated with ubiquitous movements responsible for our posture, facial expressions,
  ability to actively sample our sensory environments, and other critical processes.
  These movements are strongly related to neural activity across much of the brain
  and are often highly correlated with ongoing cognitive processes, making it challenging
  to dissociate the neural dynamics that support cognitive processes from those supporting
  related movements. In such cases, a critical issue is whether cognitive processes
  are separable from related movements, or if they are driven by common neural mechanisms.
  Here, we demonstrate how the separability of cognitive and motor processes can be
  assessed, and, when separable, how the neural dynamics associated with each component
  can be isolated. We establish a novel two-context behavioral task in mice that involves
  multiple cognitive processes and show that commonly observed dynamics taken to support
  cognitive processes are strongly contaminated by movements. When cognitive and motor
  components are isolated using a novel approach for subspace decomposition, we find
  that they exhibit distinct dynamical trajectories. Further, properly accounting
  for movement revealed that largely separate populations of cells encode cognitive
  and motor variables, in contrast to the \u2018mixed selectivity\u2019 often reported.
  Accurately isolating the dynamics associated with particular cognitive and motor
  processes will be essential for developing conceptual and computational models of
  neural circuit function and evaluating the function of the cell types of which neural
  circuits are composed."
