description: "This Dandiset contains NWB files with behavioral and extracellular electrophysiological
  recordings from six male Long-Evans rats performing a conditional free-choice task
  with probabilistic rewards. In the task, rats maintained a center nose-poke during
  an auditory cue and then chose left or right nose-pokes; reward probabilities for
  each action switched across blocks according to four (left, right) schedules: (90,50),
  (50,90), (50,10), and (10,50) percent. Single-unit activity was recorded using movable
  microwire bundles implanted in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum across
  70 sessions (\u224860,000 trials in total). For each trial, the dataset includes
  spike times, trial type (choice vs no-choice), selected action, reward outcome,
  and key event timestamps (tones, nose-pokes, pellet retrieval), all aligned within
  session time. These data were originally collected for Ito & Doya, J Neurosci 2009
  (DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6157-08.2009), which compared reinforcement-learning models
  of behavior and analyzed how action values, trial type, and reward outcome are represented
  in ventral basal ganglia. This dataset is suitable for re-analysis of decision-making
  strategies, model-based neural coding, and computational studies of cortico-basal
  ganglia circuits."
