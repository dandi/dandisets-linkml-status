  "description": "This Dandiset contains NWB files with behavioral and extracellular electrophysiological recordings from six male Long-Evans rats performing a conditional free-choice task with probabilistic rewards. In the task, rats maintained a center nose-poke during an auditory cue and then chose left or right nose-pokes; reward probabilities for each action switched across blocks according to four (left, right) schedules: (90,50), (50,90), (50,10), and (10,50) percent. Single-unit activity was recorded using movable microwire bundles implanted in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum across 70 sessions (\u224860,000 trials in total). For each trial, the dataset includes spike times, trial type (choice vs no-choice), selected action, reward outcome, and key event timestamps (tones, nose-pokes, pellet retrieval), all aligned within session time. These data were originally collected for Ito & Doya, J Neurosci 2009 (DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6157-08.2009), which compared reinforcement-learning models of behavior and analyzed how action values, trial type, and reward outcome are represented in ventral basal ganglia. This dataset is suitable for re-analysis of decision-making strategies, model-based neural coding, and computational studies of cortico-basal ganglia circuits.",
