  "description": "Data collected using a 4x4 multielectrode array (Microprobes) in propofol anesthetized rats receiving subcutaneous alternating current stimulation.\n\nRecording electrodes had platinum iridium shanks with a tip width of 125\u03bcm, an impedance of 0.4 MOhm, and were spaced 0.5mm apart in the lateral plane. An additional shank with 10 kOhm impedance served as a reference. Electrodes were inserted ~300\u03bcm into the craniotomy exposed sensorimotor cortex (L2/3). Data was acquired with a sampling rate of 24 kHz (Tucker-Davis Technologies).\n\nStimulation electrodes were adhered directly to the skull, medial and lateral the cranial window.\n\n\n\nThere are two data files.\n\nThe first contains experiments where 9 three-month old Sprague-Dawley rats received a randomized order of stimulation parameters (frequencies: 5, 10, 20, 40, and 140 Hz, amplitudes: 50, 100, 200, and 400 \u03bcA). Each dated folder contains recordings for a single rat, with subfolders for each stimulation parameter delivery (1-min baseline + 1-min sACS + 1-min baseline).\n\nThe second data file contains experiments where 13 rats received a single 20-min delivery of 40 Hz, 100 \u03bcA stimulation. Each dated folder contains experiments from a single rat. Baseline activity was recorded for 20-min before stimulation onset and subsequently following sACS for 10 minutes. Additional subfolders contain further 20-min of post stimulation baseline activity, collected to an hour following stimulation offset.",
