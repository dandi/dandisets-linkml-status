description: "Data collected using a 4x4 multielectrode array (Microprobes) in propofol
  anesthetized rats receiving subcutaneous alternating current stimulation.\n\nRecording
  electrodes had platinum iridium shanks with a tip width of 125\u03BCm, an impedance
  of 0.4 MOhm, and were spaced 0.5mm apart in the lateral plane. An additional shank
  with 10 kOhm impedance served as a reference. Electrodes were inserted ~300\u03BCm
  into the craniotomy exposed sensorimotor cortex (L2/3). Data was acquired with a
  sampling rate of 24 kHz (Tucker-Davis Technologies).\n\nStimulation electrodes were
  adhered directly to the skull, medial and lateral the cranial window.\n\n\n\nThere
  are two data files.\n\nThe first contains experiments where 9 three-month old Sprague-Dawley
  rats received a randomized order of stimulation parameters (frequencies: 5, 10,
  20, 40, and 140 Hz, amplitudes: 50, 100, 200, and 400 \u03BCA). Each dated folder
  contains recordings for a single rat, with subfolders for each stimulation parameter
  delivery (1-min baseline + 1-min sACS + 1-min baseline).\n\nThe second data file
  contains experiments where 13 rats received a single 20-min delivery of 40 Hz, 100
  \u03BCA stimulation. Each dated folder contains experiments from a single rat. Baseline
  activity was recorded for 20-min before stimulation onset and subsequently following
  sACS for 10 minutes. Additional subfolders contain further 20-min of post stimulation
  baseline activity, collected to an hour following stimulation offset."
