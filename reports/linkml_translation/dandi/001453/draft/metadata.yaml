description: 'This dataset was used in "Neural circuits underlying divergent visuomotor
  strategies of zebrafish and Danionella cerebrum" (Current Biology, 2025, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.04.027).


  Many animals respond to sensory cues with species-specific coordinated movements.1,2
  A universal visually guided behavior is the optomotor response (OMR),3,4,5,6 which
  stabilizes the body by following optic flow induced by displacements in currents.7
  While the brain-wide OMR circuits in zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been characterized,8,9,10,11,12
  the homologous neural functions across teleost species with different ecological
  niches, such as Danionella cerebrum,13,14,15 remain largely unexplored. Here, we
  directly compare larval zebrafish and D. cerebrum to uncover the neural mechanisms
  underlying the natural variation of visuomotor coordination. Closed-loop behavioral
  tracking during visual stimulation revealed that D. cerebrum follow optic flow by
  swimming continuously, punctuated with sharp directional turns, in contrast to the
  burst-and-glide locomotion of zebrafish.16 Although D. cerebrum swim at higher average
  speeds, they lack the direction-dependent velocity modulation observed in zebrafish.
  Two-photon calcium imaging and tail tracking showed that both species exhibit direction-selective
  encoding in putative homologous regions, with D. cerebrum containing more monocular
  neurons. D. cerebrum sustain significantly longer directed swims across all stimuli
  than zebrafish, with zebrafish reducing tail movement duration in response to oblique,
  turn-inducing stimuli. While locomotion-associated neurons in D. cerebrum display
  more prolonged activity than zebrafish, lateralized turn-associated neural activity
  in the hindbrain suggests a shared neural circuit architecture that independently
  controls movement vigor and direction. These findings highlight the diversity in
  visuomotor strategies among teleost species with shared circuit motifs, establishing
  a framework for unraveling the neural mechanisms driving continuous and discrete
  locomotion.'
