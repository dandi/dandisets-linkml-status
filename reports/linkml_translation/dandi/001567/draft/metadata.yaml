description: This dataset consists of EEG and LFP recordings from 64 rats (32 male,
  32 female) Sprague-Dawley rats studied for the effects of chemical nerve agents.
  Rats were acutely intoxicated with the organophosphate (OP) chemical, DFP, then
  provided with standard-of-care medication. These recordings were collected under
  the UC Davis CounterACT Center of Excellence, analyzed using Kyle Day's analysis
  tool, with the analysis guidance of the UCD Gurkoff Lab.
