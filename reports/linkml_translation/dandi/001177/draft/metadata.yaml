description: "In this project, we studied cognitive behavior and striatal activity
  in a mouse model of impulse control disorder in Parkinson\u2019s disease in which
  we administered the therapeutic dopamine D2/3R agonist, pramipexole. In food-deprived
  mice treated with bilateral striatal saline (healthy control) or 6-OHDA (mouse model
  of Parkinson\u2019s Disease), we performed both open field locomotor assessments
  and operant testing to assess a cognitive phenomenon called delay discounting (DD).
  The operant box consisted of two (left and right) choice ports with beam breaks
  for nosepokes, and a central reward port that delivered milk. In some sessions,
  we administered pramipexole intraperitoneally prior to behavioral testing. In these
  mice, we performed simultaneous optically-identified single-unit electrophysiology
  using optrode arrays implanted in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of Drd1-Cre or
  A2a-Cre mice that expressed Cre-dependent ChR2-eYFP. Electrophysiology recordings
  were performed during either open field locomotor assessments or operant testing.
  During each cognitive assessment session, behavior was monitored by video tracking
  and/or operant box TTL events (nosepokes, cue lights, reward delivery, etc). During
  each electrophysiology session, DMS voltage signals were acquired using a Blackrock
  electrophysiology recording system. At the end of each session, blue light pulses
  (473 nm laser) were delivered to the optrode array (100 msec, 1 Hz, 4000 pulses)
  at a variety of light powers (0.5, 1, 2, 4 mW) by a lightweight patch cable. After
  recording sessions, we performed manual spike sorting (Plexon Offline Sorter) to
  isolate single units. We then aligned spiking activity to light pulses to identify
  optically-labeled neurons, and aligned all single-unit activity (labeled or not)
  to behavioral data."
