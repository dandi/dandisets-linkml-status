  "description": "In this study, we investigate how transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) modulates neural interaction and response to peripheral electrical limb stimulation through intracranial multi-electrode recordings in the rat somatosensory cortex. Rats were anesthetized using isoflurane anesthesia at 2%. Recordings were taken while delivering peripheral electrical stimulation once every 5 seconds to analyze the neural response in the rat S1HL region, before and after ultrasound. We delivered ultrasound for 5 minutes in a pulsed pattern at 5 different stimulation repetition frequencies (10 Hz, 50 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 125 Hz) to induce frequency dependent plasticity in a manner similar to that found following tetanic electrical stimulation. The fundamental frequency of ultrasound used was 0.5 MHz, the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was 3 kHz, and the total duty cycle was 36%. This dataset includes spike timing data from the recordings including time before and after ultrasound stimulation, for both true ultrasound conditions and sham ultrasound conditions in which ultrasound is directed off target. Details of the study are in the following publication: S. Ramachandran, X. Niu, K. Yu, B. He, \"Transcranial ultrasound neuromodulation induces neuronal correlation change in the rat somatosensory cortex\", 2022 J. Neural Eng. 19 056002 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35947970/.
