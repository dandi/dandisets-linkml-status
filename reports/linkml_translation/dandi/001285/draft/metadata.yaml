description: "The experimental protocol for the dataset is described in detail in
  Purdon PL, Pierce ET, Mukamel EA, et al. Electroencephalogram signatures of loss
  and recovery of consciousness from propofol. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013;110(12):E1142-E1151,
  doi:10.1073/pnas.1221180110. \nIn summary, ten healthy, consenting volunteers aged
  18\u201336 years participated in a study approved by the MGH Human Research Committee.
  The study examined induction and emergence from propofol anesthesia using a computer-controlled
  infusion system (StanPump) based on the Schnider pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
  model. Subjects performed a behavioral task to identify the points of loss and recovery
  of consciousness while 64-channel EEG recordings were obtained. The protocol began
  with a 20-minute baseline EEG recording. Propofol was then administered in increasing
  effect-site concentrations, with each concentration maintained for 14 minutes, followed
  by decreasing effect-site concentrations designed to bracket the point of loss of
  consciousness. Each declining concentration was also held for 14 minutes. During
  all phases of the protocol\u2014baseline, increasing, and decreasing concentrations\u2014subjects
  performed a yes-no behavioral task every 4 seconds to document the times of loss
  and recovery of consciousness. After the propofol infusion was stopped, an additional
  20-minute baseline EEG and behavioral recording period was conducted. Throughout
  the study, participants were instructed to keep their eyes closed to minimize eye-blink
  artifacts.\n"
