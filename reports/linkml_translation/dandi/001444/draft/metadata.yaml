description: Each simulation produced 4 files and we collected 4 sets of simulations
  for a total of 16 files. Each simulation included a control and parkinsonian condition
  in the rest (quiet wakefulness) and in the activated (movement) state. Parkinsonian
  M1 simulations were different from controls in that their PT5B neurons had reduced
  excitability as found in cortical slices of 6-OHDA treated mice.Each MWB file includes
  a local field potential trace, spike train data from all 10,073 neurons, and membrane
  potential traces from 400 of the layer 5B pyramidal tract (PT5B) neurons. Simulations
  were 4.3 seconds in duration. Full information available in our paper https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.23.595566
