  "description": "Each simulation produced 4 files and we collected 4 sets of simulations for a total of 16 files. Each simulation included a control and parkinsonian condition in the rest (quiet wakefulness) and in the activated (movement) state. Parkinsonian M1 simulations were different from controls in that their PT5B neurons had reduced excitability as found in cortical slices of 6-OHDA treated mice.Each MWB file includes a local field potential trace, spike train data from all 10,073 neurons, and membrane potential traces from 400 of the layer 5B pyramidal tract (PT5B) neurons. Simulations were 4.3 seconds in duration. Full information available in our paper https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.23.595566",
