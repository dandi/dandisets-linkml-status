- description: The ~1 billion neurons that form the human brainstem are organized
    at multiple scales, ranging from their cell type-specific patterns of dendritic
    arborization, to local circuits embedded within large-scale projection systems
    spanning the brainstem, and a complex nuclear architecture. In this project, we
    will image across this vast range of scales to build technologies to create a
    multiscale atlas akin to Google Earth for the human brainstem to visualize brainstem-wide
    networks and zoom in to the level of individual, labeled cells and their connectivity
    at micrometer resolution within the context of individual nuclei. This dramatic
    advance will be made possible through the use of an array of imaging technologies,
    including light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), tissue clearing, immunohisto-chemistry
    (IHC), 2-photon expansion microscopy (2PEM), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
    and newly developed techniques in polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography
    (PS- OCT). PS-OCT in particular is a potentially transformative technology as
    it provides micrometer resolution over large volumes of tissue, images all of
    the tissue (as opposed to fluorescence), does not require mounting and staining,
    can be automated, is essentially distortion free as it images the tissue prior
    to cutting, and with innovations we propose in our project, allows direct measures
    of 3D axonal orientation. LSM-based IHC will provide molecular, morphological
    and spatial properties of cells and their projections that will enable us to nuclear
    boundaries to place the connections in a nuclear context, 2PEM will provide direct
    validation of the 3D-PSOCT, and the OCT will also enable us to remove the distortions
    induced by cutting and clearing, and transfer information to intact brainstem
    and whole-hemisphere MRI for quantitative atlasing and in vivo inference.
