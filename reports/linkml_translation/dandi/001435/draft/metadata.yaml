description: "We use our experiences to form and update beliefs about the hidden states
  of the world. When possible, we also gather evidence by observing others. However,
  how the brain integrates experiential and observational evidence is not understood.
  We studied the dynamics of evidence integration in a two-player game with volatile
  hidden states. Both humans and monkeys successfully updated their beliefs while
  playing the game and observing their partner, though less effectively when observing.
  Electrophysiological recordings in animals revealed that the anterior cingulate
  cortex (ACC) integrates independent sources of experiential and observational evidence
  into a coherent neural representation of dynamic belief about the environment\u2019s
  state. The geometry of population activity revealed the computational architecture
  of this integration and provided a neural account of the behavioral asymmetry between
  experiential and observational evidence accumulation. This work lays the groundwork
  for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying evidence accumulation in social
  contexts within the primate brain."
