studyTarget:
- "Affiliative social connections facilitate well-being and survival in numerous species.
  Engaging in social interactions requires positive or negative motivational drive,
  elicited through coordinated activity across neural circuits. However, the identity,
  interconnectivity, and functional encoding of social information within these circuits
  remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on downstream projections of dorsal raphe
  nucleus (DRN) dopamine neurons (DRNDAT), which we previously implicated in social
  motivation alongside an aversive affective state. We show that three prominent DRNDAT
  projections \u2013 to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), central amygdala
  (CeA), and posterior basolateral amygdala (BLP) \u2013 play separable roles in behavior,
  despite substantial collateralization. Photoactivation of the DRNDAT-CeA projection
  promoted social behavior and photostimulation of the DRNDAT-BNST projection promoted
  exploratory behavior, while the DRNDAT-BLP projection supported place avoidance,
  suggesting a negative affective state. Downstream regions showed diverse receptor
  expression, poising DRNDAT neurons to act through dopamine, neuropeptide, and glutamate
  transmission. Furthermore, we show ex vivo that the effect of DRNDAT photostimulation
  on downstream neuron excitability depended on region and baseline cell properties,
  resulting in excitatory responses in BNST cells and diverse responses in CeA and
  BLP. Finally, in vivo microendoscopic cellular-resolution recordings in the CeA
  with DRNDAT photostimulation revealed a correlation between social behavior and
  neurons excited by social stimuli\u2013 suggesting that increased dopamine tone
  may recruit different CeA neurons to social ensembles. Collectively, these circuit
  features may facilitate a coordinated, but flexible, response in the presence of
  social stimuli that can be flexibly guided based on the internal social homeostatic
  need state of the individual."

    via precise modulation of cellular activity in broadly-distributed target structures."
