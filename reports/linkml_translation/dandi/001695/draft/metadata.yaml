description: 'Overview This dataset provides high-density, simultaneous extracellular
  recordings from the mouse hippocampal formation (DG, CA1, CA2, CA3) and the retrosplenial
  cortex (RSC). The data captures large-scale neural dynamics across homecage rest,
  spatial navigation, and sensory stimulation.


  Methodology:

  Probes: Recordings were performed using Neuropixels 2.0 (CA3, CA1, RSC) and 1024-channel
  SiNAPS probes (DG, CA3, CA2, CA1).

  Behavioral Paradigms: Neuropixels sessions include PRE-rest, Maze navigation (Novel
  or 2-maze configurations), and POST-rest homecage recordings. A subset of animals
  includes head-fixed odor stimulation.

  SiNAPS sessions include High-density head-fixed recordings.


  Data Included:

  Sorted isolated units (Spikes).

  Local Field Potentials (LFP), specifically including single-channel traces from
  ripple-detection sites.

  Behavioral tracking variables (position, velocity, sleep periods, sharp-wave ripple
  times).
