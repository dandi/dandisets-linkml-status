  "description": "Overview This dataset provides high-density, simultaneous extracellular recordings from the mouse hippocampal formation (DG, CA1, CA2, CA3) and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The data captures large-scale neural dynamics across homecage rest, spatial navigation, and sensory stimulation.\n\nMethodology:\nProbes: Recordings were performed using Neuropixels 2.0 (CA3, CA1, RSC) and 1024-channel SiNAPS probes (DG, CA3, CA2, CA1).\nBehavioral Paradigms: Neuropixels sessions include PRE-rest, Maze navigation (Novel or 2-maze configurations), and POST-rest homecage recordings. A subset of animals includes head-fixed odor stimulation.\nSiNAPS sessions include High-density head-fixed recordings.\n\nData Included:\nSorted isolated units (Spikes).\nLocal Field Potentials (LFP), specifically including single-channel traces from ripple-detection sites.\nBehavioral tracking variables (position, velocity, sleep periods, sharp-wave ripple times).\n\n",
