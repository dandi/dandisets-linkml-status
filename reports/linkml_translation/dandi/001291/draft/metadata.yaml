description: "In this project, we present a remote scanning light-sheet microscope
  capable of imaging GEVI-expressing neurons distributed throughout entire brains
  of larval zebrafish at a volumetric rate of 200.8 Hz. We measured voltage of \u223C1/3
  of the neurons of the brain, distributed throughout. Here the raw light-sheet voltage
  imaging datasets of larval zebrafish brains, captured using this new microscope,
  were shared publicly. Please see the bioRxiv preprint https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.15.571964v1
  for more details."
