description: "In these recordings, we tested different PRFs (pulse repetition frequencies)
  of ultrasound stimulation using a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer
  to stimulate the somatosensory cortex of awake head-fixed rats. Chronic electrophysiological
  recordings were acquired using 32-channel NeuroNexus electrodes (Model: A1x32-Poly3-10mm-50-177-Z32),
  chronically implanted into the rat brain. Ultrasound stimulation is delivered every
  2.5 seconds with a 10% jitter, and each recording has 500 trials. The PRFs tested
  were 30 Hz, 300 Hz, 1500 Hz, 3000 Hz, and 4500 Hz, each with a 200 microsecond pulse
  duration and a 67 ms ultrasound duration. Anesthetized files were performed under
  2% isoflurane anesthesia for comparison.File InformationAll 10 subjects were male
  rats, implanted with their chronic electrode at 6 months of age and then recordings
  taken first at 8-10 months, and then some repeats taken at 12 months. Within each
  subject's folder are recordings for the different PRFs. Most subjects have 5 recordings
  within, one for each PRF. Some subjects have duplicate recordings taken a few months
  after the original ones. A few recordings were not included due to excessive noise
  in the recordings. Files are named in the format SubjectName_PRF_PulseDuration.
  Each file contains spike time data with the cell type labels included for each neurons,
  as well as time series data for the onset of each trial of ultrasound stimulation.
  Detailed description about this dataset can be found in the following publication.
