  "description": "This Dandiset contains session-wise NWB files converted from legacy MATLAB data for in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice navigating a virtual corridor guided by auditory cues. Imaging targeted posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and adjacent posteromedial cortex (PM) across layers 2/3 and 5 while animals ran on a spherical treadmill in darkness with continuous or intermittent sound feedback. The dataset includes segmented ROI masks and population activity (raw ratio and \u0394F/F) as RoiResponseSeries, together with aligned behavioral signals (locomotion/position, forward\u2013lateral speed, lick rate, sound on/off indicators, and reward events) stored under the behavior module. Sampling is uniform at ~30.9 Hz for imaging and behavior, enabling trial-level analyses of neural dynamics during goal-directed navigation. These data support investigations of multisensory integration and predictive coding in posterior cortical areas and are closely related to the study by Funamizu, Kuhn & Doya (Nature Neuroscience, 2016), which reported PPC/PM representations consistent with dynamic Bayesian inference during an auditory virtual-reality task (doi:10.1038/nn.4390). Please cite that article when using this dataset.",
