description: 'Flexible responses to sensory stimuli based on changing rules are critical
  for adapting to a dynamic environment. However, it remains unclear how the brain
  encodes and uses rule information to guide behavior. Here, we made single-unit recordings
  while head-fixed mice performed a cross-modal sensory selection task where they
  switched between two rules: licking in response to tactile stimuli while rejecting
  visual stimuli, or vice versa. Along a cortical sensorimotor processing stream including
  the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory areas, and the medial (MM) and
  anterolateral (ALM) motor areas, single-neuron activity distinguished between the
  two rules both prior to and in response to the tactile stimulus. We hypothesized
  that neural populations in these areas would show rule-dependent preparatory states,
  which would shape the subsequent sensory processing and behavior. This hypothesis
  was supported for the motor cortical areas (MM and ALM) by findings that (1) the
  current task rule could be decoded from pre-stimulus population activity; (2) neural
  subspaces containing the population activity differed between the two rules; and
  (3) optogenetic disruption of pre-stimulus states impaired task performance. Our
  findings indicate that flexible action selection in response to sensory input can
  occur via configuration of preparatory states in the motor cortex.'
