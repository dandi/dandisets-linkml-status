description: 'In this study, we investigate the neuronal response to transcranial
  focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS) on the somatosensory cortex using a 128-element
  array transducer and a chronically implanted ultraflexible nanoelectric thread electrode.
  This flexible electrode allows us to  study higher intensities of tFUS which are
  impossible with a rigid electrode due to the vibration artifacts that are created.
  Here we test 5 different levels of in situ ultrasound pressure including 100, 400,
  700, 1000, and 1300 kPa. We then tested the effect of varying duty cycle while keeping
  the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) constant while using the highest peak-peak
  pressure (1300 kPa), testing duty cycles of 0.6%, 6%, 30%, 60%, and 90% while holding
  PRF at 1500 Hz. Finally we tested the effect of varying PRF while holding duty cycle
  constant, testing PRFs of 30, 300, 1500, 3000, and 4500 Hz with a duty cycle of
  30%. In each of these, the fundamental frequency of ultrasound was 1500 kHz, and
  the ultrasound duration was 67 ms, with trials performed every 2 seconds, with a
  jitter of 10%. Each recording has 505 trials. '
