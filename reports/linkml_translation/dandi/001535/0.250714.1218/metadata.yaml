description: 'Long-term electrocorticographic (ECoG) training data during contextual
  brain computer interface (BCI) control in a tetraplegic human participant. The data
  uploaded represent long-term recordings from a 128 channel ECoG grid over contralateral
  sensorimotor cortex when trying to access directions in 3D space (6 axial directions
  plus 1 for the origin for a total of 7 directional targets). Data from individual
  variable length training trials from these long-term recordings have been collated
  and uploaded for the development and testing of novel BCI decoding architectures.
  For example, these trials can be used to train proficient deep learning neural network
  based BCI decoders to discern directional control. The trials are collated from
  a multitude of BCI contexts e.g., control in a virtual environment, with a physical
  real-world robot, during open loop and closed loop control. The neural features
  are a combination of high gamma amplitude activity (70-150Hz) and low-frequency
  motor cortical potentials (<25Hz), down sampled from the original 1KhZ sampling
  rate to 100Hz. Paper describing the scientific rationale, engineering approach,
  signal processing, experiments, data and a baseline deep learning decoder (stacked
  bi-directional LSTMs) can be found here: https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00157-6   '
