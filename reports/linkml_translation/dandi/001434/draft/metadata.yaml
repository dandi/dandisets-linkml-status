description: 'Striatal acetylcholine (ACh) signaling is thought to counteract reinforcement
  signals, promoting extinction and behavioral flexibility. Changes in striatal ACh
  signals have been reported during learning, but how ACh signals for learning and
  extinction are spatially organized to enable region specific plasticity is unclear.
  We used array photometry in mice to reveal a topography of opposing changes in ACh
  release across distinct striatal regions. Reward prediction error encoding was localized
  to specific phases of ACh dynamics in anterior dorsal striatum (aDS): positive and
  negative prediction errors were expressed in dips and elevations respectively. Silencing
  ACh release in aDS impaired extinction, suggesting a role for ACh elevations in
  down-regulating cue reward associations. Dopamine release in aDS dipped for cues
  during extinction, inverse to ACh, while glutamate input onto cholinergic interneurons
  was unchanged. These findings pinpoint where and suggest an intrastriatal mechanism
  for how ACh dynamics shape region-specific plasticity to gate learning and promote
  extinction.'
