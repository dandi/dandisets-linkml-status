description: "In this study, we investigate the neuronal response to transcranial
  focused ultrasound (tFUS) stimulation on somatosensory cortex by using a 128-element
  array transducer. Intracranial recordings were performed using a 32-channel Neuronexus
  multi-electrode array from somatosensory cortex. Wistar rats were anesthetized using
  isoflurane at 2%. tFUS with different parameters was applied every 2.5s (\xB110%).
  Data was recorded using a TDT system and MUA recordings were sorted using the Plexon
  Offline Sorter to determine the spike times.This dataset contains spike times of
  the sorted neural signals and event time for each tFUS trial. In these recordings,
  we test different pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) (30Hz, 300Hz, 1500Hz, 3000Hz,
  and 4500Hz), ultrasound durations (UDs) (100\xB5s, 200\xB5s, and 400\xB5s) of ultrasound
  stimulation to explore the neuronal response to tFUS. The pulse duration was kept
  at 67ms. Each recording has 500 trials. Detailed description about this dataset
  can be found in the following publication. Please cite the paper if you would use
  a portion of the dataset. Gao, H., Ramachandran, S., Yu, K., & He, B. (2025). Transcranial
  Focused Ultrasound Modulates Feedforward and Feedback Cortico-Thalamo-Cortical Pathways
