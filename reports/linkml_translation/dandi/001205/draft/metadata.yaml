description: "Associated Reference Publication: Sensory systems adapt their response
  properties to the statistics of their inputs. For instance, visual systems adapt
  to low-order statistics like mean and variance to encode stimuli efficiently or
  to facilitate specific downstream computations. However, it remains unclear how
  other statistical features affect sensory adaptation. Here, we explore how Drosophila\u2019s
  visual motion circuits adapt to stimulus sparsity, a measure of the signal\u2019s
  intermittency not captured by low-order statistics alone. Early visual neurons in
  both ON and OFF pathways alter their responses dramatically with stimulus sparsity,
  responding positively to both light and dark sparse stimuli but linearly to dense
  stimuli. These changes extend to downstream ON and OFF direction-selective neurons,
  which are activated by sparse stimuli of both polarities, but respond with opposite
  signs to light and dark regions of dense stimuli. Thus, sparse stimuli activate
  both ON and OFF pathways, recruiting a larger fraction of the circuit and potentially
  enhancing the salience of isolated stimuli. Overall, our results reveal visual response
  properties that increase the fraction of the circuit responding to sparse, isolated
  stimuli."
