  "description": "In this dataset, we recorded 32-channel EEG and 64-channel intracranial signals from wild-type male rats and male rats with seizures induced by repeated 4-AP injections to investigate the effects of white-matter-targeted transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) on seizure inhibition. The 4-AP cocktail was injected into the right S1, and intracranial recordings were obtained from the left S1. The \"labeled data\" include seizure onset and offset times for each seizure, which were used to compare the tFUS and sham (no tFUS) conditions for each rat. Each rat has data from 4\u20135 sessions, each lasting approximately one hour: BASELINE (pre-tFUS or pre-sham), condition (CC_1Hz or sham), post1 (first hour post-stimulation), post2 (second hour post-stimulation), and post3 (third hour post-stimulation).tFUS was delivered using a 128-element transducer targeting the corpus callosum (CC, predominantly white matter) with a 1 Hz pulse repetition frequency (PRF), 2% duty cycle (DC), and ~127 kPa peak pressure. The \"EP data\" contain evoked potentials used to verify accurate targeting of the stimulation site with 1500Hz PRF, 30% DC and 67ms ultrasound duration (UD). The \"EEG data for PLV\" includes the EEG data for connectivity analysis of wild-type rats. Detailed description of this dataset can be found in the following publication.
