description: 'Several forebrain areas project to the nucleus of the solitary tract
  (NST) and modulate neural processing of orosensory gustatory information.  Some
  sources of descending input such as the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) may
  utilize somatostatin (Sst) because CeA/Sst neurons are a source of descending input
  to the NST and suppression of their neural activity influences ingestion of quinine
  HCl.  Nevertheless, the postsynaptic target(s) of CeA/Sst and non Sst-expressing
  neurons in the rostral gustatory portion of the NST (rNST) is unknown as is the
  brain area(s) targeted by rNST neurons that receive synaptic input from the CeA.  In
  this study, we show that CeA axon terminals in the rNST are GABAergic and primarily
  synapse with non GABAergic neurons such as glutamate, calretinin, and Phox2b expressing
  neurons.  We discovered that these neurons primarily project to the contralateral
  NST and medullary reticular formation (RF) as well as the ipsilateral RF and pontine
  parabrachial nucleus (PBN).  Together, the present results suggest that CeA input
  to these rNST neuronal populations may influence diverse processes including coding
  of ascending gustatory information and orosensory modulation of licking, mastication,
  and salivation.  '
