description: "This Dandiset contains Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) files with behavioral
  and extracellular electrophysiological recordings from seven male Long\u2013Evans
  rats performing fixed-choice and free-choice nose-poke tasks with probabilistic
  rewards. In each trial, rats initiated a center nose-poke, received one of three
  cue tones (left, right, or choice), maintained the poke during the cue, and then
  chose the left or right port; sucrose pellets were delivered according to cue- and
  action-dependent reward probabilities. For left and right cues, reward probabilities
  were fixed at (left, right) = (50%, 0%) and (0%, 50%), respectively, whereas for
  the choice cue they varied blockwise across four schedules: (90%, 50%), (50%, 90%),
  (50%, 10%), and (10%, 50%). \nNeural activity was recorded with movable microwire
  bundles implanted in dorsolateral striatum (DLS), dorsomedial striatum (DMS), and
  ventral striatum (VS), yielding phasically active neurons (putative medium spiny
  neurons) from each subregion across 86 sessions and ~78,000 trials. For each session,
  the NWB files provide spike times (and associated unit metadata where available)
  together with detailed behavioral event timestamps (tone onsets/offsets, nose-poke
  entries/exits, reward/no-reward tones, pellet detection), block type (single fixed-choice,
  double fixed-choice, free-choice, extinction), cue identity, chosen action, and
  reward outcome, all aligned in session time. These data were originally collected
  for the Journal of Neuroscience article \u201CDistinct neural representation in
  the dorsolateral, dorsomedial, and ventral parts of the striatum during fixed- and
  free-choice tasks\u201D (Ito & Doya, 2015, J Neurosci 35(8):3499\u20133514, DOI:
  10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1962-14.2015), which analyzed how state value, action value, reward
  outcome, and action commands are differentially represented across striatal subregions.
  This dataset enables re-analysis of decision-making strategies, model-based and
  model-free value coding, and hierarchical reinforcement-learning hypotheses in cortico-basal
  ganglia circuits."
