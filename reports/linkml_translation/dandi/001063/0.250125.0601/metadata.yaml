description: "Our intuition suggests that when a movie is played in reverse, our perception
  of motion in the reversed movie will be perfectly inverted compared to the original.
  This intuition is also reflected in many classical theoretical and practical models
  of motion detection. However, here we demonstrate that this symmetry of motion perception
  upon time reversal is often broken in real visual systems. In this work, we designed
  a set of visual stimuli to investigate how stimulus symmetries affect time reversal
  symmetry breaking in the fruit fly Drosophila\u2019s well-studied optomotor rotation
  behavior. We discovered a suite of new stimuli with a wide variety of different
  properties that can lead to broken time reversal symmetries in fly behavioral responses.
  We then trained neural network models to predict the velocity of scenes with both
  natural and artificial contrast distributions. Training with naturalistic contrast
  distributions yielded models that break time reversal symmetry, even when the training
  data was time reversal symmetric. We show analytically and numerically that the
  breaking of time reversal symmetry in the model responses can arise from contrast
  asymmetry in the training data, but can also arise from other features of the contrast
  distribution. Furthermore, shallower neural network models can exhibit stronger
  symmetry breaking than deeper ones, suggesting that less flexible neural networks
  promote some forms of time reversal symmetry breaking. Overall, these results reveal
  a surprising feature of biological motion detectors and suggest that it could arise
  from constrained optimization in natural environments."
