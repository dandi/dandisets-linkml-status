description: 'The International Brain lab (IBL) aims to understand the neural basis
  of decision-making in the mouse by gathering a whole-brain activity map composed
  of electrophysiological recordings pooled from multiple laboratories. We have systematically
  recorded from nearly all major brain areas with Neuropixels probes, using a grid
  system for unbiased sampling and replicating each recording site in at least two
  laboratories. These data have been used to construct a brain-wide map of activity
  at single-spike cellular resolution during a decision-making task. In addition to
  the map, this data set contains other information gathered during the task: sensory
  stimuli presented to the mouse; mouse decisions and response times; and mouse pose
  information from video recordings and DeepLabCut analysis.'
