description: "The dataset contains electrophysiological signals from both healthy
  and parkinsonian subjects. We generated two types of samples from each group. The
  parkinsonian signals show a relatively high power density at the beta frequency
  (13 to 30 Hz). Thus, the beta oscillations (13 to 30 Hz) in the subthalamic nucleus
  (STN) are typically used as the pathological biomarkers for PD symptoms. Each sample
  includes two types of signals: Beta Average Rectified Voltage (ARV) and Local Field
  Potential (LFP) from the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN). The ARV signals are in the frequency
  domain and LFP signals are in the time domain.\n\nBeta ARV Signal: The controller
  beta values are determined by calculating the Average Rectified Value (ARV) of the
  beta band. This is achieved by fully rectifying the filtered LFP signal using a
  fourth-order Chebyshev band-pass filter with an 8 Hz bandwidth, centered around
  the peak of the LFP power spectrum. Local Field Potential (LFP) - STN: Local Field
  Potentials are derived from the synchronized activity of neuron populations between
  the cortex, STN, and thalamus.\n\nMore details can be found in our article named,
