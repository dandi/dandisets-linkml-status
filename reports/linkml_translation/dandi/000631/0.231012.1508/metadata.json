  "description": "In the study, the impact of varying the electric field vector on the effectiveness of electroporation was examined, utilizing both paired-pulse trains, consisting of 5 pulses at 600 + 600 ns, and single-pulse trains with 5 pulses at 600 ns. These were applied to a BPAE cell monolayer at frequencies of either 1 Hz or 833 kHz. The focus was on assessing the alterations in electroporation efficiency, gauged through the changes in YoPro-1 emission when compared to the baseline established by a single-pulse train in the identical region of interest, which was set at 100%. The evaluation criteria included the angle at which the electric field vector direction alternated between two pulses within a pair. Introduction of pulses in pairs amplified the electroporation efficiency at smaller angles but resulted in an inhibition at larger angles, indicating a frequency-dependent relationship. The images captured during the experiments provided a comprehensive visualization of this effect, highlighting the nuanced impact of electric field vector modifications on electroporation efficiency.
