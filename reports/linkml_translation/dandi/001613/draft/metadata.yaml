description: 'This dataset includes 50 recording sessions of intracranial EEG and
  simultaneous eyetracking from 46 individual patients. Implants consist of a total
  of 10,790 contacts predominantly from depth electrodes, and 988 from ECoG contacts
  (grids and strips). Patients watched up to 53.6 minutes of movies (48 recordings),
  completed resting state (25 recordings) and viewed static images (31 recordings).
  Data is provided in NWB format and includes local field potentials, electrode locations.
  gaze and pupil size, precise timing of each frame in the movie. The data also includes
  annotations of words and phonemes in one of the movies, as well as annotions of
  faces in three movies. '
