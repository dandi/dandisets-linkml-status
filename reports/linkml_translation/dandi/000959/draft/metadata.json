  "description": "These are the raw and processed data accompanying our manuscript \"Closed-loop microstimulations of the orbitofrontal cortex during real-life gaze interaction enhance dynamic social attention\". In this paradigm, two animals face each-other and freely gaze at one another while their gaze positions are continuously tracked in real-time. One animal (\"M1\") receives a low-amplitude microstimulation to one of three brain areas (OFC, ACCg, and dmPFC) that is triggered stochastically upon looking to their partner's eye-region. These data consist of the continuous gaze positions and pupil sizes from each animal; the stimulation event times; the face and eye ROIs of each animal; and the multi-unit activity (MUA) and electrode information from the single electrode targeting the stimulated area.",
