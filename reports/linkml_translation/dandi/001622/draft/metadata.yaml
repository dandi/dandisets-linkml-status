description: 'This dataset contains raw and partially processed electrophysiological
  recordings collected from the hippocampus of adult rats under anesthesia. Recordings
  were acquired using multi-channel silicon probes and the Open Ephys acquisition
  system, stored in .dat format. The dataset spans multiple sessions capturing spontaneous
  neural activity under stable anesthetic conditions.


  Initial spike sorting and analysis have been performed using SpikeInterface-compatible
  tools. Future versions of this dataset may include NWB-formatted files, enhanced
  metadata, and annotations related to probe placement, anesthesia protocol, and signal
  quality metrics.


  This draft is intended for internal collaboration and pipeline development. Metadata
  and structure are subject to revision.'
