  "description": "This dataset contains raw and partially processed electrophysiological recordings collected from the hippocampus of adult rats under anesthesia. Recordings were acquired using multi-channel silicon probes and the Open Ephys acquisition system, stored in .dat format. The dataset spans multiple sessions capturing spontaneous neural activity under stable anesthetic conditions.\n\nInitial spike sorting and analysis have been performed using SpikeInterface-compatible tools. Future versions of this dataset may include NWB-formatted files, enhanced metadata, and annotations related to probe placement, anesthesia protocol, and signal quality metrics.\n\nThis draft is intended for internal collaboration and pipeline development. Metadata and structure are subject to revision.",
