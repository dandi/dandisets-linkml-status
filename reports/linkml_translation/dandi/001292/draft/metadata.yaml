description: Corticothalamic projections to sensorimotor thalamic nuclei show modest
  firing rates and serve to modulate the activity of thalamic relay neurons. By contrast,
  here we find that high-order corticothalamic projections from the prelimbic (PL)
  cortex to the anterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus (aPVT) maintain high-frequency
  activity and evoke strong synaptic excitation of aPVT neurons in rats. In a significant
  fraction of aPVT cells, such high-frequency excitation of PL-aPVT projections leads
  to a rapid decay of action potential amplitudes, followed by a depolarization block
  (DB) that strongly limits aPVT maximum firing rates, thereby regulating both defensive
  and appetitive behaviors in a frequency-dependent manner. Strong inhibitory inputs
  from the anteroventral portion of the thalamic reticular nucleus (avTRN) inhibit
  the firing rate of aPVT neurons during periods of high-spike fidelity but restore
  it during prominent DB, suggesting that avTRN activity can modulate the effects
  of PL inputs on aPVT firing rates to ultimately control motivated behaviors.
