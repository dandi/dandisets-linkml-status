  "description": "Spontaneous neuronal activities were extracted from GCaMP and tagRFP images, covering nearly all neurons in the nematode C. elegans brain. In addition, neuronal identity information was derived from NeuroPAL signals. During the data acquisition, the worms were semi-immobilized in a microfluidic device. Note: There are occasional transient failures in neuronal tracking. We recommend that researchers use a moving median filter (e.g., \u00b13) to address this issue.",
