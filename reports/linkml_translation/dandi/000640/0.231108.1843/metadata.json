  "description": "Male Long Evans Rats 7-12 months of age. 24 total animals. 256 sessions.  13 animals received a frontal traumatic brain injury (controlled cortical impact). 11 animals received Sham (no craniotomy no TBI) conditions. One week later, rats underwent a second surgery to implant 32 electrodes (Francoeur et al., Front. Psychiatry, 2021). Rats were trained to perform a self-paced probabilistic reversal learning task in a custom operant box with five noseports, stepper-motors to deliver water reward, houselight, and auditory tones. Local field potential (LFP) streams recorded simultaneously from 32 Brain Regions - recorded using a 32-Channel RHD headstage coupled to a RHD USB interface board (Intan Technologies). Open Ephys software at 1KHz band-pass filter set at 0.3-999Hz during acquisition. Lab-streaming-layer (LSL) was used to integrate physiology data with behavior. Physiology can be time-locked to trial onset (rat responds to start trial), response (rat choice between noseports), reward (time of reward delivery)",
