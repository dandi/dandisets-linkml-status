  "description": "We have extracted, curated using field standards, and shared over 2,054,021 SWR events from 258 mice from these datasets as well as the code used to process them.  Data is from Neuropixels LFP data from the Allen Brain Institute Visual Behaviour and Visual Coding Datasets as well as the International Brain Laboratory Decision Making Task Dataset.  SWR start stop times, peak ripple power, and peak power times are reported to allow for analysis with spiking and behavioral data in those datasets.",
