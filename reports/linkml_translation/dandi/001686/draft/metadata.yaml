description: Neuromodulatory systems regulate neural circuits across broad regions
  of the brain, and disruption of the dopaminergic system contributes to psychiatric
  and neurodegenerative disorders. Engineered viral vectors have been used to target
  the neuromodulatory systems of the nonhuman primate brain (Y. Chen et al., 2023;
  El-Shamayleh et al., 2016; Gray et al., 2010; Lerchner et al., 2014; Perez et al.,
  2022). However, a conspicuous obstacle to the isolation and modulation of specific
  pathways is the inability of many retrogradely infecting viruses to transduce dopaminergic
  (DA) cells efficiently (Tervo et al., 2016; Cushnie et al., 2020; Weiss et al.,
  2020). We compare the DA neuron retrograde transduction efficacy of four viral vectors
  after injection into the striatum of nonhuman primates (NHP). Selectivity was assessed
  by comparing the neuronal co-expression of fluorescent reporter protein and tyrosine-hydroxylase
  (TH) antibody in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The rabies pseudotyped lentiviral
  vector, FuGB2, produced superior retrograde transduction of DA cells to FuG-C or
  FuG-E. AAV2.retro was the least effective.
