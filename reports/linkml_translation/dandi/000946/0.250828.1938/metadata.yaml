description: 'In these recordings, we recorded neuronal activities from cortical-thalamocortical
  (CTC) pathway, including the somatosensory cortex (S1) and posteromedial complex
  (POm) of the thalamus responded to different PRFs (pulse repetition frequencies)
  or Pulse Durations (PDs) of transcranial ultrasound focused stimulation (tFUS) using
  a 128-element transducer to stimulate either at S1. Also, we tested the neural responses
  of the auditory cortex (AC) with tFUS targeting at S1. Recordings for each target
  are taken using 32-channel Neuronexus electrodes. Ultrasound stimulation is delivered
  every 2.5 seconds and each recording has 500 trials. The ultrasound duration and
  pressure level used in each recording is 67ms and ~90kPa. The PRFs and PDs for each
  recording can be found in the identifier field. For example, in BH494_1500_200_67_5,
  the PRF is 1500Hz and PD is 200us.Each recording contains two areas (64-channel).
  The spike time tiling coefficient (STTC) of neurons cross-area and within-area is
  included in the folders named with STTC.  The detailed description on the data can
  be found in the following publication:   Gao, H., Ramachandran, S., Yu, K., & He,
  B. (2025). Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Feedforward and Feedback Cortico-Thalamo-Cortical
  Pathways by Selectively Activating Excitatory Neurons. The Journal of Neuroscience,
  45(23), e2218242025. https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2218-24.2025.  If you would
  use part of the dataset, please cite the above publication.'
