description: "Rats transfected with a viral strategy to express a light-activated
  channel (ChR2) in PV+ neurons within the MS of PV-Cre transgenic rats. We also implanted
  an optic fiber targeting the MS as well as either silicon electrodes or multi-tetrode
  arrays targeting the hippocampus. Each of these animals received optical stimulation
  restricted to periods of locomotion on either a lineartrack, a W-shaped track, or
  both. The stimulation pattern was governed by a protocol that either activated MS
  PV neurons at a wide range of requested frequencies (\u201Crhythmic stimulation\u201D)
  or at specific phases of the ongoing theta rhythm (\u201Cphase-specific stimulation\u201D)
  recorded in the hippocampus. Released in conjunction with the publication \"Disruption
  of theta-timescale spiking impairs learning but spares hippocampal replay\"."
