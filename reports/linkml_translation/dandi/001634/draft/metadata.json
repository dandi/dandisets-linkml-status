  "description": "Rats transfected with a viral strategy to express a light-activated channel (ChR2) in PV+ neurons within the MS of PV-Cre transgenic rats. We also implanted an optic fiber targeting the MS as well as either silicon electrodes or multi-tetrode arrays targeting the hippocampus. Each of these animals received optical stimulation restricted to periods of locomotion on either a lineartrack, a W-shaped track, or both. The stimulation pattern was governed by a protocol that either activated MS PV neurons at a wide range of requested frequencies (\u201crhythmic stimulation\u201d) or at specific phases of the ongoing theta rhythm (\u201cphase-specific stimulation\u201d) recorded in the hippocampus. Released in conjunction with the publication \"Disruption of theta-timescale spiking impairs learning but spares hippocampal replay\".",
