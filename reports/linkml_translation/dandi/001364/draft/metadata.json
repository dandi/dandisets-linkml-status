  "description": "Nonradiative photothermal (PT) and photoacoustic (PA) processes have found widespread applications in imaging, stimulation, and therapy. Mapping the generation and propagation of PA and PT waves with resolution is important to elucidate how these fields interact with biological systems. To this end, we introduce spatial offset pump-probe imaging (SOPPI). By spatially offsetting the pump beam and the probe beam, SOPPI can image simultaneously PA and PT wave propagation with nanosecond temporal resolution, micrometer spatial resolution, 65 MHz detection bandwidth, and a sensitivity of 9.9 Pa noise equivalent pressure. We map the PA and PT evolution from a fiber emitter, to understand the generated field. This information can guide us on PA neuromodulation on retina. ",
