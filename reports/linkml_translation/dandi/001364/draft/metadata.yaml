description: 'Nonradiative photothermal (PT) and photoacoustic (PA) processes have
  found widespread applications in imaging, stimulation, and therapy. Mapping the
  generation and propagation of PA and PT waves with resolution is important to elucidate
  how these fields interact with biological systems. To this end, we introduce spatial
  offset pump-probe imaging (SOPPI). By spatially offsetting the pump beam and the
  probe beam, SOPPI can image simultaneously PA and PT wave propagation with nanosecond
  temporal resolution, micrometer spatial resolution, 65 MHz detection bandwidth,
  and a sensitivity of 9.9 Pa noise equivalent pressure. We map the PA and PT evolution
  from a fiber emitter, to understand the generated field. This information can guide
  us on PA neuromodulation on retina. '
