description: "The My Seizure Gauge project is a multicenter effort to build an openly
  sharable, multimodal wearable dataset that pairs long-duration biosensor recordings
  with concurrently validated EEG seizures to advance ambulatory seizure-forecasting
  research. In this release we include ultra-long-term data from the Empatica E4 wristband
  and the Fitbit Inspire/Charge HR. Concurrent EEG validation of seizures was achieved
  using NeuroPace RNS, Medtronic RC+S, UNEEG SubQ, or EpiMinder Minder devices. Details
  are included for each dataset. Most subjects wore the devices for 6-12 months, although
  here we include some shorter records from subjects who dropped out of the study
  early. \n\nPlease cite Nasseri, Stirling et. al. Epilepsia 2025 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/epi.18466)
  in any publications using this data. "
