  "description": "This dataset contains recordings of neural activity using two-photon calcium imaging from the mouse primary visual cortex (VISp). The mice had GCaMP8s expressed in their inhibitory interneurons (Slc32a1). The experiments were conducted using the same data collection pipeline as the Allen Brain Observatory (de Vries et al., Nature Neurosci., 2020), with an improved microscopy system that uses multi-plane imaging. A running wheel was used to track locomotion. The recordings were performed during two different visual stimulus sets: 1. STAGE_0: Natural movie clips. 2. STAGE_1: Drifting gratings presented as full-field stimuli (approximately 120x90 degrees of visual space). These gratings were presented in 8 directions, at 5 contrasts (5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%), as well as 8 directions, and 5 temporal frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 Hz). This dataset also includes the gene expression tables associated with subsets of neurons in the neural recording dataset. The gene expression was quantified using HCR (Hybridization Chain Reaction) method and multiple rounds of multichannel lightsheet imaging. Transcriptomic data in available in a Github repository: https://github.com/omidzobeiri/CellxGene_tables_U01_130907_DS001532",
